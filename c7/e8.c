/*
    Modify assumption a. in exercise 7 so that the program presents a menu of
    pay rates from which to choose. Use a switch to select the pay rate. The
    beginning of a run should look something like this:

    *****************************************************************
    Enter the number corresponding to the desired pay rate or action:
    1) $8.75/hr                         2) $9.33/hr
    3) $10.00/hr                        4) $11.20/hr
    5) quit
    *****************************************************************

    If choices 1 through 4 are selected the program should request the hours
    worked. The Program should recycle until 5 is entered. If something other
    than choices 1 through 5 is entered, the program should remind the user what
    the proper choices are and then recycle. Use #defined constants for the
    various earning rates and tax rates.
